As part of the arrangement, Groq’s founder and former CEO Jonathan Ross, a veteran Google engineer, along with the company’s president and senior engineers, are joining Nvidia to help advance and scale the licensed technology. Despite speculation about a $20 billion transaction, Groq will continue to operate independently under a new leadership team following the transfer of several executives.
