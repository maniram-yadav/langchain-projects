Google’s Gemini app can now tap into the company’s powerful Shopping Graph data set of products and sellers, and can even use its agentic technology to call stores on your behalf. Meanwhile, back in November, OpenAI announced a ChatGPT shopping feature capable of rapidly compiling buyer’s guides, and the company has struck deals with Walmart, Target, and Etsy to allow shoppers to buy products directly within chatbot interactions.\\n\\nExpect plenty more of these kinds of deals to be struck within the next year as consumer time spent chatting with AI keeps on rising, and web traffic from search engines and social media continues to plummet.\\n\\n—Rhiannon Williams [...] In place of state laws, Trump promises to work with Congress to establish a federal AI law.

In 2026, expect more political warfare. The White House and states will spar over who gets to govern the booming technology, while AI companies wage a fierce lobbying campaign to crush regulations, armed with the narrative that a patchwork of state laws will smother innovation and hobble the US in the AI arms race against China.',\n",

The internet changed everything. Mobile reshaped consumer behavior. Cloud computing was transformative.\\n\\nBut this moment is different.\\n\\nIt’s not just that AI is powerful. It’s that the S-curves are compressing. The distance between emerging and mainstream is collapsing.\\n\\nOrganizations built for sequential improvement can’t compete with those operating in continuous learning loops. The traditional playbook assumed you had time to get it right. That assumption no longer holds. [...] The technology meant to give businesses an advantage is becoming the target used against them. AT&T’s chief information security officer captured the challenge: “What we’re experiencing today is no different than what we’ve experienced in the past. The only difference with AI is speed and impact.”12Organizations must secure AI across four domains—data, models, applications, and infrastructure—but they also have the opportunity to use AI-powered defenses to fight threats operating at machine speed.\\n\\nThroughout this year’s report, you’ll meet technology leaders successfully navigating this sea change. They don’t have all the answers, but there are noticeable patterns as they light the way forward. [...] Only 11% of organizations have agents in production, despite 38% piloting them. The gap between pilot to production tells you everything. Forty-two percent are still developing their strategy, while 35% have no strategy at all.7 Gartner predicts that 40% of agentic projects will fail by 20278—not because the technology doesn’t work, but because organizations are automating broken processes instead of redesigning operations. HPE’s chief financial officer captured what works: “We wanted to select an end-to-end process where we could truly transform, not just solve for a single pain point.”9 Redesign, don’t automate. That’s the pattern separating success from failure.\\n\\nImage 16\\n\\nThe AI infrastructure reckoning: Optimizing compute strategy in the age of inference economics\", \"score\": 0.7283819}, {\"title\": \"What's next for AI in 2026 | MIT Technology Review\", \"url\": \"https://www.technologyreview.com/2026/01/05/1130662/whats-next-for-ai-in-2026/\", \"content\": \"### The US will face another year of regulatory tug-of-war\\n\\nT​​he battle over regulating artificial intelligence is heading for a showdown. On December 11, President Donald Trump signed an executive order aiming to neuter state AI laws, a move meant to handcuff states from keeping the growing industry in check. In 2026, expect more political warfare. The White House and states will spar over who gets to govern the booming technology, while AI companies wage a fierce lobbying campaign to crush regulations, armed with the narrative that a patchwork of state laws will smother innovation and hobble the US in the AI arms race against China.\", \"score\": 0.72814995}, {\"title\": \"10 AI Predictions For 2026 - Forbes\", \"url\": \"https://www.forbes.com/sites/robtoews/2025/12/22/10-ai-predictions-for-2026/\", \"content\": \"And, to be clear, Sam Altman will not be leaving the spotlight. He will have plenty of ventures in chips, data centers, space, BCI and more for many years to come.\\n\\n8. AI will be one of the central issues in the 2026 U.S. midterm elections. The politics will get complex, especially when it comes to AI-driven job loss.\\n\\nIn 2026, especially as we get further into the year, the news cycle in the United States will be dominated by the midterm elections. And these midterm elections will be dominated by the topic of artificial intelligence.\\n\\nThe stakes are high in these midterms, which will be seen as a definitive barometer of the country’s support for President Trump’s polarizing presidency. [...] But China has many talented engineers, vast resources and a deep national commitment to this effort. In 2026, China’s domestic chip industry will make concrete, meaningful progress toward closing the gap with the U.S. on AI hardware. It will not yet achieve parity with Nvidia’s most advanced chips; it will not even come close; but by the end of 2026, it will be evident that China’s chip industry is on a productive path and is making steady progress toward the frontier of AI chip production.\\n\\nIn the fullness of time, a robust, dynamic, cutting-edge AI chip ecosystem in China will be the worst possible outcome for Nvidia and for U.S. policymakers hoping for a technological edge against China.\\n\\n4. Discourse about AGI and superintelligence will become less fashionable and less common. [...] On the non-invasive side, ultrasound-based techniques will emerge as the buzziest and most promising BCI approach. Startups like Nudge (which recently announced a $100 million Series A led by Thrive and Greenoaks) and Merge Labs (Sam Altman’s new BCI startup, into which OpenAI is reportedly investing hundreds of millions of dollars) will rank among 2026’s trendiest companies and will raise big new rounds. Other non-invasive approaches, including silent speech and EEG, will also enjoy plenty of momentum.\", \"score\": 0.72348577}, {\"title\": \"What's next in AI: 7 trends to watch in 2026 - Microsoft Source\", \"url\": \"https://news.microsoft.com/source/features/ai/whats-next-in-ai-7-trends-to-watch-in-2026/\", \"content\": \"by Susanna Ray \\n\\nAI is entering a new phase, one defined by real-world impact.\\n\\nAfter several years of experimentation, 2026 is shaping up to be the year AI evolves from instrument to partner, transforming how we work, create and solve problems. Across industries, AI is moving beyond answering questions to collaborating with people and amplifying their expertise.\\n\\nThis transformation is visible everywhere. In medicine, AI is helping close gaps in care. In software development, it’s learning not just code but the context behind it. In scientific research, it’s becoming a true lab assistant. In quantum computing, new hybrid approaches are heralding breakthroughs once thought impossible. [...] As AI agents become digital colleagues and take on specific tasks at human direction, organizations are strengthening security to keep pace with new risks. The infrastructure powering these advances is also maturing, with smarter, more efficient systems.\\n\\nThese seven trends to watch in 2026 show what’s possible when people join forces with AI.\\n\\nImage 4\\n\\nAI will amplify what people can achieve together\\n\\nAparna Chennapragada, Microsoft’s chief product officer for AI experiences, sees 2026 as a new era for alliances between technology and people. If recent years were about AI answering questions and reasoning through problems, the next wave will be about true collaboration, Chennapragada says.\\n\\n“The future isn’t about replacing humans,” she says. “It’s about amplifying them.” [...] Image 7\\n\\nAI will become central to the research process\\n\\nAI is already speeding up breakthroughs in fields like climate modeling, molecular dynamics and materials design, says Peter Lee, president of Microsoft Research. But the next leap is coming. In 2026, AI won’t just summarize papers, answer questions and write reports — it will actively join the process of discovery in physics, chemistry and biology.\\n\\n“AI will generate hypotheses, use tools and apps that control scientific experiments, and collaborate with both human and AI research colleagues,” Lee says.\", \"score\": 0.71496695}, {\"title\": \"In 2026, AI will move from hype to pragmatism | TechCrunch\", \"url\": \"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/02/in-2026-ai-will-move-from-hype-to-pragmatism/\", \"content\": \"Getting physical\\n\\nImage 7\\n\\nImage Credits:David Paul Morris/Bloomberg / Getty Images\\n\\nAdvancements in technologies like small models, world models, and edge computing will enable more physical applications of machine learning, experts say.\\n\\n“Physical AI will hit the mainstream in 2026 as new categories of AI-powered devices, including robotics, AVs, drones, and wearables start to enter the market,” Vikram Taneja, head of AT&T Ventures, told TechCrunch. [...] While autonomous vehicles and robotics are obvious use cases for physical AI that will no doubt continue to grow in 2026, the training and deployment required is still expensive. Wearables, on the other hand, provide a less expensive wedge with consumer buy-in. Smart glasses like the Ray-Ban Meta are starting to ship assistants that can answer questions about what you’re looking at, and new form factors like AI-powered health rings and smartwatches are normalizing always-on, on-body inference.\\n\\n“Connectivity providers will work to optimize their network infrastructure to support this new wave of devices, and those with flexibility in how they can offer connectivity will be best positioned,” Taneja said.\\n\\nTopics\\n\\nAI, AI agents, mcp, physical ai, small language models, world models\\n\\n[]( [...] In 2026, AI will move from hype to pragmatism | TechCrunch\\n\\nDo you hate pop-ups?\\n\\nSo do we!
