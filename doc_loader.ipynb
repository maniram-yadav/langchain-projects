Several proof-of-concepts demos, such as AutoGPT, GPT-Engineer and BabyAGI, serve as inspiring examples. The potentiality of LLM extends beyond generating well-written copies, stories, essays and programs; it can be framed as a powerful general problem solver.\\nAgent System Overview#\\nIn a LLM-powered autonomous agent system, LLM functions as the agent’s brain, complemented by several key components:\\n\\nPlanning\\n\\nSubgoal and decomposition: The agent breaks down large tasks into smaller, manageable subgoals, enabling efficient handling of complex tasks.\\nReflection and refinement: The agent can do self-criticism and self-reflection over past actions, learn from mistakes and refine them for future steps, thereby improving the quality of final results.\\n\\n\\nMemory\\n\\nShort-term memory: I would consider all the in-context learning (See Prompt Engineering) as utilizing short-term memory of the model to learn.\\nLong-term memory: This provides the agent with the capability to retain and recall (infinite) information over extended periods, often by leveraging an external vector store and fast retrieval.\\n\\n\\nTool use\\n\\nThe agent learns to call external APIs for extra information that is missing from the model weights (often hard to change after pre-training), including current information, code execution capability, access to proprietary information sources and more.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOverview of a LLM-powered autonomous agent system.\\n\\nComponent One: Planning#\\nA complicated task usually involves many steps. An agent needs to know what they are and plan ahead.\\nTask Decomposition#\\nChain of thought (CoT; Wei et al. 2022) has become a standard prompting technique for enhancing model performance on complex tasks. The model is instructed to “think step by step” to utilize more test-time computation to decompose hard tasks into smaller and simpler steps. CoT transforms big tasks into multiple manageable tasks and shed lights into an interpretation of the model’s thinking process.\\nTree of Thoughts (Yao et al. 2023) extends CoT by exploring multiple reasoning possibilities at each step. It first decomposes the problem into multiple thought steps and generates multiple thoughts per step, creating a tree structure. The search process can be BFS (breadth-first search) or DFS (depth-first search) with each state evaluated by a classifier (via a prompt) or majority vote.\\nTask decomposition can be done (1) by LLM with simple prompting like \"Steps for XYZ.\\\\n1.\", \"What are the subgoals for achieving XYZ?\", (2) by using task-specific instructions; e.g. \"Write a story outline.\" for writing a novel, or (3) with human inputs.\\nAnother quite distinct approach, LLM+P (Liu et al. 2023), involves relying on an external classical planner to do long-horizon planning. This approach utilizes the Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL) as an intermediate interface to describe the planning problem. In this process, LLM (1) translates the problem into “Problem PDDL”, then (2) requests a classical planner to generate a PDDL plan based on an existing “Domain PDDL”, and finally (3) translates the PDDL plan back into natural language. Essentially, the planning step is outsourced to an external tool, assuming the availability of domain-specific PDDL and a suitable planner which is common in certain robotic setups but not in many other domains.\\nSelf-Reflection#\\nSelf-reflection is a vital aspect that allows autonomous agents to improve iteratively by refining past action decisions and correcting previous mistakes. It plays a crucial role in real-world tasks where trial and error are inevitable.\\nReAct (Yao et al. 2023) integrates reasoning and acting within LLM by extending the action space to be a combination of task-specific discrete actions and the language space. The former enables LLM to interact with the environment (e.g. use Wikipedia search API), while the latter prompting LLM to generate reasoning traces in natural language.\\nThe ReAct prompt template incorporates explicit steps for LLM to think, roughly formatted as:\\nThought: ...\\nAction: ...\\nObservation: ...\\n... (Repeated many times)\\n\\n\\nExamples of reasoning trajectories for knowledge-intensive tasks (e.g. HotpotQA, FEVER) and decision-making tasks (e.g. AlfWorld Env, WebShop). (Image source: Yao et al. 2023).\\n\\nIn both experiments on knowledge-intensive tasks and decision-making tasks, ReAct works better than the Act-only baseline where Thought: … step is removed.\\nReflexion (Shinn & Labash 2023) is a framework to equip agents with dynamic memory and self-reflection capabilities to improve reasoning skills. Reflexion has a standard RL setup, in which the reward model provides a simple binary reward and the action space follows the setup in ReAct where the task-specific action space is augmented with language to enable complex reasoning steps. After each action $a_t$, the agent computes a heuristic $h_t$ and optionally may decide to reset the environment to start a new trial depending on the self-reflection results.\\n\\n\\nIllustration of the Reflexion framework. (Image source: Shinn & Labash, 2023)\\n\\nThe heuristic function determines when the trajectory is inefficient or contains hallucination and should be stopped. Inefficient planning refers to trajectories that take too long without success. Hallucination is defined as encountering a sequence of consecutive identical actions that lead to the same observation in the environment.\\nSelf-reflection is created by showing two-shot examples to LLM and each example is a pair of (failed trajectory, ideal reflection for guiding future changes in the plan). Then reflections are added into the agent’s working memory, up to three, to be used as context for querying LLM.\\n\\n\\nExperiments on AlfWorld Env and HotpotQA. Hallucination is a more common failure than inefficient planning in AlfWorld. (Image source: Shinn & Labash, 2023)\\n\\nChain of Hindsight (CoH; Liu et al. 2023) encourages the model to improve on its own outputs by explicitly presenting it with a sequence of past outputs, each annotated with feedback. Human feedback data is a collection of $D_h = \\\\{(x, y_i , r_i , z_i)\\\\}_{i=1}^n$, where $x$ is the prompt, each $y_i$ is a model completion, $r_i$ is the human rating of $y_i$, and $z_i$ is the corresponding human-provided hindsight feedback. Assume the feedback tuples are ranked by reward, $r_n \\\\geq r_{n-1} \\\\geq \\\\dots \\\\geq r_1$ The process is supervised fine-tuning where the data is a sequence in the form of $\\\\tau_h = (x, z_i, y_i, z_j, y_j, \\\\dots, z_n, y_n)$, where $\\\\leq i \\\\leq j \\\\leq n$. The model is finetuned to only predict $y_n$ where conditioned on the sequence prefix, such that the model can self-reflect to produce better output based on the feedback sequence. The model can optionally receive multiple rounds of instructions with human annotators at test time.\\nTo avoid overfitting, CoH adds a regularization term to maximize the log-likelihood of the pre-training dataset. To avoid shortcutting and copying (because there are many common words in feedback sequences), they randomly mask 0% - 5% of past tokens during training.\\nThe training dataset in their experiments is a combination of WebGPT comparisons, summarization from human feedback and human preference dataset.\\n\\n\\nAfter fine-tuning with CoH, the model can follow instructions to produce outputs with incremental improvement in a sequence. (Image source: Liu et al. 2023)\\n\\nThe idea of CoH is to present a history of sequentially improved outputs  in context and train the model to take on the trend to produce better outputs. Algorithm Distillation (AD; Laskin et al. 2023) applies the same idea to cross-episode trajectories in reinforcement learning tasks, where an algorithm is encapsulated in a long history-conditioned policy. Considering that an agent interacts with the environment many times and in each episode the agent gets a little better, AD concatenates this learning history and feeds that into the model. Hence we should expect the next predicted action to lead to better performance than previous trials. The goal is to learn the process of RL instead of training a task-specific policy itself.\\n\\n\\nIllustration of how Algorithm Distillation (AD) works. (Image source: Laskin et al. 2023).\\n\\nThe paper hypothesizes that any algorithm that generates a set of learning histories can be distilled into a neural network by performing behavioral cloning over actions. The history data is generated by a set of source policies, each trained for a specific task. At the training stage, during each RL run, a random task is sampled and a subsequence of multi-episode history is used for training, such that the learned policy is task-agnostic.\\nIn reality, the model has limited context window length, so episodes should be short enough to construct multi-episode history. Multi-episodic contexts of 2-4 episodes are necessary to learn a near-optimal in-context RL algorithm. The emergence of in-context RL requires long enough context.\\nIn comparison with three baselines, including ED (expert distillation, behavior cloning with expert trajectories instead of learning history), source policy (used for generating trajectories for distillation by UCB), RL^2 (Duan et al. 2017; used as upper bound since it needs online RL), AD demonstrates in-context RL with performance getting close to RL^2 despite only using offline RL and learns much faster than other baselines. When conditioned on partial training history of the source policy, AD also improves much faster than ED baseline.\\n\\n\\nComparison of AD, ED, source policy and RL^2 on environments that require memory and exploration. Only binary reward is assigned. The source policies are trained with A3C for \"dark\" environments and DQN for watermaze.(Image source: Laskin et al. 2023)\\n\\nComponent Two: Memory#\\n(Big thank you to ChatGPT for helping me draft this section. I’ve learned a lot about the human brain and data structure for fast MIPS in my conversations with ChatGPT.)\\nTypes of Memory#\\nMemory can be defined as the processes used to acquire, store, retain, and later retrieve information. There are several types of memory in human brains.\\n\\n\\nSensory Memory: This is the earliest stage of memory, providing the ability to retain impressions of sensory information (visual, auditory, etc) after the original stimuli have ended. Sensory memory typically only lasts for up to a few seconds. Subcategories include iconic memory (visual), echoic memory (auditory), and haptic memory (touch).\\n\\n\\nShort-Term Memory (STM) or Working Memory: It stores information that we are currently aware of and needed to carry out complex cognitive tasks such as learning and reasoning. Short-term memory is believed to have the capacity of about 7 items (Miller 1956) and lasts for 20-30 seconds.\\n\\n\\nLong-Term Memory (LTM): Long-term memory can store information for a remarkably long time, ranging from a few days to decades, with an essentially unlimited storage capacity. There are two subtypes of LTM:\\n\\nExplicit / declarative memory: This is memory of facts and events, and refers to those memories that can be consciously recalled, including episodic memory (events and experiences) and semantic memory (facts and concepts).\\nImplicit / procedural memory: This type of memory is unconscious and involves skills and routines that are performed automatically, like riding a bike or typing on a keyboard.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCategorization of human memory.\\n\\nWe can roughly consider the following mappings:\\n\\nSensory memory as learning embedding representations for raw inputs, including text, image or other modalities;\\nShort-term memory as in-context learning. It is short and finite, as it is restricted by the finite context window length of Transformer.\\nLong-term memory as the external vector store that the agent can attend to at query time, accessible via fast retrieval.\\n\\nMaximum Inner Product Search (MIPS)#\\nThe external memory can alleviate the restriction of finite attention span.  A standard practice is to save the embedding representation of information into a vector store database that can support fast maximum inner-product search (MIPS). To optimize the retrieval speed, the common choice is the approximate nearest neighbors (ANN)\\u200b algorithm to return approximately top k nearest neighbors to trade off a little accuracy lost for a huge speedup.\\nA couple common choices of ANN algorithms for fast MIPS:\\n\\nLSH (Locality-Sensitive Hashing): It introduces a hashing function such that similar input items are mapped to the same buckets with high probability, where the number of buckets is much smaller than the number of inputs.\\nANNOY (Approximate Nearest Neighbors Oh Yeah): The core data structure are random projection trees, a set of binary trees where each non-leaf node represents a hyperplane splitting the input space into half and each leaf stores one data point. Trees are built independently and at random, so to some extent, it mimics a hashing function. ANNOY search happens in all the trees to iteratively search through the half that is closest to the query and then aggregates the results. The idea is quite related to KD tree but a lot more scalable.\\nHNSW (Hierarchical Navigable Small World): It is inspired by the idea of small world networks where most nodes can be reached by any other nodes within a small number of steps; e.g. “six degrees of separation” feature of social networks. HNSW builds hierarchical layers of these small-world graphs, where the bottom layers contain the actual data points. The layers in the middle create shortcuts to speed up search. When performing a search, HNSW starts from a random node in the top layer and navigates towards the target. When it can’t get any closer, it moves down to the next layer, until it reaches the bottom layer. Each move in the upper layers can potentially cover a large distance in the data space, and each move in the lower layers refines the search quality.\\nFAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search): It operates on the assumption that in high dimensional space, distances between nodes follow a Gaussian distribution and thus there should exist clustering of data points. FAISS applies vector quantization by partitioning the vector space into clusters and then refining the quantization within clusters. Search first looks for cluster candidates with coarse quantization and then further looks into each cluster with finer quantization.\\nScaNN (Scalable Nearest Neighbors): The main innovation in ScaNN is anisotropic vector quantization. It quantizes a data point $x_i$ to $\\\\tilde{x}_i$ such that the inner product $\\\\langle q, x_i \\\\rangle$ is as similar to the original distance of $\\\\angle q, \\\\tilde{x}_i$ as possible, instead of picking the closet quantization centroid points.\\n\\n\\n\\nComparison of MIPS algorithms, measured in recall@10.

We create, modify and utilize external objects to do things that go beyond our physical and cognitive limits. Equipping LLMs with external tools can significantly extend the model capabilities.\\n\\n\\nA picture of a sea otter using rock to crack open a seashell, while floating in the water. While some other animals can use tools, the complexity is not comparable with humans. (Image source: Animals using tools)\\n\\nMRKL (Karpas et al. 2022), short for “Modular Reasoning, Knowledge and Language”, is a neuro-symbolic architecture for autonomous agents. A MRKL system is proposed to contain a collection of “expert” modules and the general-purpose LLM works as a router to route inquiries to the best suitable expert module. These modules can be neural (e.g. deep learning models) or symbolic (e.g. math calculator, currency converter, weather API).\\nThey did an experiment on fine-tuning LLM to call a calculator, using arithmetic as a test case. Their experiments showed that it was harder to solve verbal math problems than explicitly stated math problems because LLMs (7B Jurassic1-large model) failed to extract the right arguments for the basic arithmetic reliably. The results highlight when the external symbolic tools can work reliably, knowing when to and how to use the tools are crucial, determined by the LLM capability.\\nBoth TALM (Tool Augmented Language Models; Parisi et al. 2022) and Toolformer (Schick et al. 2023) fine-tune a LM to learn to use external tool APIs. The dataset is expanded based on whether a newly added API call annotation can improve the quality of model outputs. See more details in the “External APIs” section of Prompt Engineering.\\nChatGPT Plugins and OpenAI API  function calling are good examples of LLMs augmented with tool use capability working in practice. The collection of tool APIs can be provided by other developers (as in Plugins) or self-defined (as in function calls).\\nHuggingGPT (Shen et al. 2023) is a framework to use ChatGPT as the task planner to select models available in HuggingFace platform according to the model descriptions and summarize the response based on the execution results.\\n\\n\\nIllustration of how HuggingGPT works. (Image source: Shen et al. 2023)\\n\\nThe system comprises of 4 stages:\\n(1) Task planning: LLM works as the brain and parses the user requests into multiple tasks. There are four attributes associated with each task: task type, ID, dependencies, and arguments. They use few-shot examples to guide LLM to do task parsing and planning.\\nInstruction:\\n\\nThe AI assistant can parse user input to several tasks: [{\"task\": task, \"id\", task_id, \"dep\": dependency_task_ids, \"args\": {\"text\": text, \"image\": URL, \"audio\": URL, \"video\": URL}}]. The \"dep\" field denotes the id of the previous task which generates a new resource that the current task relies on. A special tag \"-task_id\" refers to the generated text image, audio and video in the dependency task with id as task_id. The task MUST be selected from the following options: {{ Available Task List }}. There is a logical relationship between tasks, please note their order. If the user input can\\'t be parsed, you need to reply empty JSON. Here are several cases for your reference: {{ Demonstrations }}. The chat history is recorded as {{ Chat History }}. From this chat history, you can find the path of the user-mentioned resources for your task planning.\\n\\n(2) Model selection: LLM distributes the tasks to expert models, where the request is framed as a multiple-choice question. LLM is presented with a list of models to choose from. Due to the limited context length, task type based filtration is needed.\\nInstruction:\\n\\nGiven the user request and the call command, the AI assistant helps the user to select a suitable model from a list of models to process the user request. The AI assistant merely outputs the model id of the most appropriate model. The output must be in a strict JSON format: \"id\": \"id\", \"reason\": \"your detail reason for the choice\". We have a list of models for you to choose from {{ Candidate Models }}. Please select one model from the list.\\n\\n(3) Task execution: Expert models execute on the specific tasks and log results.\\nInstruction:\\n\\nWith the input and the inference results, the AI assistant needs to describe the process and results. The previous stages can be formed as - User Input: {{ User Input }}, Task Planning: {{ Tasks }}, Model Selection: {{ Model Assignment }}, Task Execution: {{ Predictions }}. You must first answer the user\\'s request in a straightforward manner. Then describe the task process and show your analysis and model inference results to the user in the first person. If inference results contain a file path, must tell the user the complete file path.\\n\\n(4) Response generation: LLM receives the execution results and provides summarized results to users.\\nTo put HuggingGPT into real world usage, a couple challenges need to solve: (1) Efficiency improvement is needed as both LLM inference rounds and interactions with other models slow down the process; (2) It relies on a long context window to communicate over complicated task content; (3) Stability improvement of LLM outputs and external model services.\\nAPI-Bank (Li et al. 2023) is a benchmark for evaluating the performance of tool-augmented LLMs. It contains 53 commonly used API tools, a complete tool-augmented LLM workflow, and 264 annotated dialogues that involve 568 API calls. The selection of APIs is quite diverse, including search engines, calculator, calendar queries, smart home control, schedule management, health data management, account authentication workflow and more. Because there are a large number of APIs, LLM first has access to API search engine to find the right API to call and then uses the corresponding documentation to make a call.\\n\\n\\nPseudo code of how LLM makes an API call in API-Bank. (Image source: Li et al. 2023)\\n\\nIn the API-Bank workflow, LLMs need to make a couple of decisions and at each step we can evaluate how accurate that decision is. Decisions include:\\n\\nWhether an API call is needed.\\nIdentify the right API to call: if not good enough, LLMs need to iteratively modify the API inputs (e.g. deciding search keywords for Search Engine API).\\nResponse based on the API results: the model can choose to refine and call again if results are not satisfied.\\n\\nThis benchmark evaluates the agent’s tool use capabilities at three levels:\\n\\nLevel-1 evaluates the ability to call the API. Given an API’s description, the model needs to determine whether to call a given API, call it correctly, and respond properly to API returns.\\nLevel-2 examines the ability to retrieve the API. The model needs to search for possible APIs that may solve the user’s requirement and learn how to use them by reading documentation.\\nLevel-3 assesses the ability to plan API beyond retrieve and call. Given unclear user requests (e.g. schedule group meetings, book flight/hotel/restaurant for a trip), the model may have to conduct multiple API calls to solve it.\\n\\nCase Studies#\\nScientific Discovery Agent#\\nChemCrow (Bran et al. 2023) is a domain-specific example in which LLM is augmented with 13 expert-designed tools to accomplish tasks across organic synthesis, drug discovery, and materials design. The workflow, implemented in LangChain, reflects what was previously described in the ReAct and MRKLs and combines CoT reasoning with tools relevant to the tasks:\\n\\nThe LLM is provided with a list of tool names, descriptions of their utility, and details about the expected input/output.\\nIt is then instructed to answer a user-given prompt using the tools provided when necessary. The instruction suggests the model to follow the ReAct format - Thought, Action, Action Input, Observation.\\n\\nOne interesting observation is that while the LLM-based evaluation concluded that GPT-4 and ChemCrow perform nearly equivalently, human evaluations with experts oriented towards the completion and chemical correctness of the solutions showed that ChemCrow outperforms GPT-4 by a large margin. This indicates a potential problem with using LLM to evaluate its own performance on domains that requires deep expertise. The lack of expertise may cause LLMs not knowing its flaws and thus cannot well judge the correctness of task results.\\nBoiko et al. (2023) also looked into LLM-empowered agents for scientific discovery, to handle autonomous design, planning, and performance of complex scientific experiments. This agent can use tools to browse the Internet, read documentation, execute code, call robotics experimentation APIs and leverage other LLMs.\\nFor example, when requested to \"develop a novel anticancer drug\", the model came up with the following reasoning steps:\\n\\ninquired about current trends in anticancer drug discovery;\\nselected a target;\\nrequested a scaffold targeting these compounds;\\nOnce the compound was identified, the model attempted its synthesis.\\n\\nThey also discussed the risks, especially with illicit drugs and bioweapons. They developed a test set containing a list of known chemical weapon agents and asked the agent to synthesize them. 4 out of 11 requests (36%) were accepted to obtain a synthesis solution and the agent attempted to consult documentation to execute the procedure. 7 out of 11 were rejected and among these 7 rejected cases, 5 happened after a Web search while 2 were rejected based on prompt only.\\nGenerative Agents Simulation#\\nGenerative Agents (Park, et al. 2023) is super fun experiment where 25 virtual characters, each controlled by a LLM-powered agent, are living and interacting in a sandbox environment, inspired by The Sims. Generative agents create believable simulacra of human behavior for interactive applications.\\nThe design of generative agents combines LLM with memory, planning and reflection mechanisms to enable agents to behave conditioned on past experience, as well as to interact with other agents.\\n\\nMemory stream: is a long-term memory module (external database) that records a comprehensive list of agents’ experience in natural language.\\n\\nEach element is an observation, an event directly provided by the agent.\\n- Inter-agent communication can trigger new natural language statements.\\n\\n\\nRetrieval model: surfaces the context to inform the agent’s behavior, according to relevance, recency and importance.\\n\\nRecency: recent events have higher scores\\nImportance: distinguish mundane from core memories. Ask LM directly.\\nRelevance: based on how related it is to the current situation / query.\\n\\n\\nReflection mechanism: synthesizes memories into higher level inferences over time and guides the agent’s future behavior. They are higher-level summaries of past events (<- note that this is a bit different from self-reflection above)\\n\\nPrompt LM with 100 most recent observations and to generate 3 most salient high-level questions given a set of observations/statements. Then ask LM to answer those questions.\\n\\n\\nPlanning & Reacting: translate the reflections and the environment information into actions\\n\\nPlanning is essentially in order to optimize believability at the moment vs in time.\\nPrompt template: {Intro of an agent X}. Here is X\\'s plan today in broad strokes: 1)\\nRelationships between agents and observations of one agent by another are all taken into consideration for planning and reacting.\\nEnvironment information is present in a tree structure.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe generative agent architecture. (Image source: Park et al. 2023)\\n\\nThis fun simulation results in emergent social behavior, such as information diffusion, relationship memory (e.g. two agents continuing the conversation topic) and coordination of social events (e.g. host a party and invite many others).\\nProof-of-Concept Examples#\\nAutoGPT has drawn a lot of attention into the possibility of setting up autonomous agents with LLM as the main controller. It has quite a lot of reliability issues given the natural language interface, but nevertheless a cool proof-of-concept demo. A lot of code in AutoGPT is about format parsing.\\nHere is the system message used by AutoGPT, where {{...}} are user inputs:\\nYou are {{ai-name}}, {{user-provided AI bot description}}.\\nYour decisions must always be made independently without seeking user assistance.

The design of the system has to work with this limited communication bandwidth, while mechanisms like self-reflection to learn from past mistakes would benefit a lot from long or infinite context windows. Although vector stores and retrieval can provide access to a larger knowledge pool, their representation power is not as powerful as full attention.\\n\\n\\nChallenges in long-term planning and task decomposition: Planning over a lengthy history and effectively exploring the solution space remain challenging. LLMs struggle to adjust plans when faced with unexpected errors, making them less robust compared to humans who learn from trial and error.\\n\\n\\nReliability of natural language interface: Current agent system relies on natural language as an interface between LLMs and external components such as memory and tools. However, the reliability of model outputs is questionable, as LLMs may make formatting errors and occasionally exhibit rebellious behavior (e.g. refuse to follow an instruction). Consequently, much of the agent demo code focuses on parsing model output.\\n\\n\\nCitation#\\nCited as:\\n\\nWeng, Lilian. (Jun 2023). “LLM-powered Autonomous Agents”.

That is, are they good for the day-to-day work\\nof language speciﬁcation, mechanization, and compiler correctness? The author\\nhypothesizes that the answer is yes because these models satisfy three important\\nproperties.\\ncompositional The semantics are deﬁned by structural recursion on syntax [72].\\nextensional The semantics specify externally observable behavior [55].\\nelementary The semantics use quite simple mathematics [51].\\nCompositionality enables proof by structural induction on the syntax, which\\nsimpliﬁes proofs of properties such as type soundness and compiler correctness.\\nII\\nExtensionality is beneﬁcial because, ultimately, a language speciﬁcation must\\nbe extensional; intensional semantics require the circuitous step of erasing in-\\nternal behavior. The use of only elementary mathematics, that is, mathematics\\nfamiliar to undergraduates in computer science, is beneﬁcial because language\\nspeciﬁcations should be readable by all computer scientists and because the size\\nof a language’s metatheory depends on the complexity of the mathematics.\\nHistorically, the two main approaches to specifying programming languages\\nhave been denotational semantics [56, 58] and operational semantics [16, 24, 39,\\n42, 49]. Denotational semantics are compositional and extensional but the stan-\\ndard lattice-based models are not elementary. Their mathematical complexity\\nis evident in the size of mechanized deﬁnitions of the λ-calculus: Benton et al.\\n[12] build a model in 11,000 LOC and Dockins [20] in 54,104 LOC (though it is\\ndiﬃcult to determine how many of those LOC is strictly necessary).\\nOperational semantics are elementary but neither extensional nor composi-\\ntional. A mechanized deﬁnition of the λ-calculus using operational techniques is\\nunder 100 LOC. Small-step semantics are intensional in that the input-output\\nbehavior of a program is a by-product of a sequence of transitions. Big-step se-\\nmantics are intensional in that the value of a λ abstraction is a syntactic object,\\na closure [38]. The lack of compositionality in operational semantics imposes\\nsigniﬁcant costs when reasoning about programs: sophisticated techniques such\\nas logical relations [48, 64] and simulations [4, 44] are often necessary. For ex-\\nample, the correctness proofs for the CompCert C compiler made extensive use\\nof simulations but sometimes resorted to translation validation in cases where\\nveriﬁcation was too diﬃcult or expensive [40, 65]. Likewise, the logical relations\\nnecessary to handle modern languages are daunting in their complexity [5, 33].\\nBut what if there were denotational semantics that were also elementary? In\\nfact, in the 1970’s and 1980’s several groups of researchers discovered elementary\\nmodels for the untyped λ-calculus. Plotkin [50, 51] and Engeler [23] discovered\\nelementary models based on two insights:\\n1. it suﬃces to use a ﬁnite approximation of a function’s graph when passing\\nit to another function, and\\n2. self application can be handled by allowing larger approximations to be used\\nwhen a smaller approximation is expected.\\nCoppo et al. [17] discovered type-theoretic models for the λ-calculus based on\\ntwo insights:\\n1. that the behavior of λ abstractions can be completely characterized by in-\\ntersection types, and\\n2. self application can be handled using subtyping.\\nPlotkin [51] shows how the elementary and type-theoretic models are closely\\nrelated. The above pairs of insights are really the same insights.\\nContributions This paper makes several technical contributions that begin to\\nanswer the question of whether elementary models are a good choice for pro-\\ngramming language speciﬁcation, mechanization, and compiler correctness.

To yield a more intuitive model for the CBV λ-calculus, we construct a do-\\nmain that approximates functions literally by their ﬁnite graphs (Section 3).\\nThe mechanization is under 100 LOC.\\n2. We give a type-theoretic version of this model based on intersection types\\n(50 LOC) and prove that the two are isomorphic (Section 4).\\n3. We give the ﬁrst mechanized proofs of soundness and completeness for a\\nelementary model with respect to operational semantics. We also mechanize\\nsoundness with respect to contextual equivalence (Section 5).\\n4. We show how compositionality can be beneﬁcial by proving correctness for\\na compiler optimization pass that performs inlining in under 100 LOC (Sec-\\ntion 6).\\n5. Toward scaling to more language features, we formulate the semantics in\\na monadic style (Section 7) and we deﬁne a semantics for a language with\\nﬁrst-class parametric polymorphism and general recursion and mechanize its\\nproof of semantic type soundness (Section 8).\\nWe begin with a review of the three elementary semantics of Plotkin [51], En-\\ngeler [23], and Coppo et al.

The common parts are parameterized, i.e., EX where X ∈{P, E}.\\n2.1\\nSet-Theoretic Models\\nThe domains of Plotkin [50, 51] and Engeler [23] are P(DP ) and P(De), where\\nDP and DE and inductively deﬁned by the following recursive equations.\\nDP = Z + Pf(DP ) × Pf(DP )\\nDE = Z + Pf(DE) × DE\\nWe let d range over elements of DP or DE, and D ranges over ﬁnite sets of\\nthem. For Plotkin, an element (D, D′) ∈P(DP ) represents a single input-output\\nentry in the graph of a function. For ﬁrst-order functions over integers, D and\\nD′ are just singletons. For higher-order functions, D and D′ are ﬁnite subsets\\nof a function’s graph. It turns out that ﬁnite sets in output position are not\\nnecessary. One of Plotkin’s entries (D, {d′\\n1, . . . , d′\\nn}) is instead represented by\\nmultiple entries (D, d′\\n1), . . . , (D, d′\\nn) in Engeler’s model.\\nThe wonderful thing about P(DP ) and P(De) is their simplicity. Their con-\\nstruction does not require advanced techniques such as inverse limits [56, 63, 70].\\nBoth DP and DE are straightforward to deﬁne as algebraic datatypes in proof\\nassistants such as Isabelle or Coq. In Isabelle, the fset library provides ﬁnite\\nsets, but one could also use lists at the cost of a few extra lemmas.\\nPlotkin [50, 51] used his domain to give a semantics to the λβ-calculus\\nwhereas Engeler [23] used his to give semantics to combinatory logic (the S and\\nK combinators). In this paper, we are instead concerned with a CBV λ-calculus.\\nTo make for a clear comparison with our work, we adapt their semantics to\\nCBV λ-calculus, deﬁning EP and EE in Figure 2. We conjecture that these two\\nsemantics are equivalent to our own.\\nNow to explain the two semantics in Figure 2. As usual, we write ρ(x:=d) for\\nthe map that sends x to d and any other variable y to ρ(y). In EP , the meaning\\nof an abstraction λx. e is the set of all input-output entries (D, D′) such that\\nD′ is a subset of the meaning of the body e in a context where x:=D. Similarly,\\nV\\nin EE, the meaning of an abstraction λx. e is the set of all input-output entries\\n(D, d′) such that d′ is an element in meaning of the e with x:=D. Regarding\\nthe meaning of function application (e1 e2), EE collects up all of the outputs d′\\nfrom the entries (D, d′) in the meaning of e1 whenever D an ﬁnite approximation\\nof the argument e2. A ﬁnite approximation is good enough because, during a\\nterminating call to a higher-order function, only a ﬁnite number of calls will\\nbe made to its argument. For a non-terminating call, the semantics assigns the\\nmeaning ∅. The use of subset in D ⊆EE[[e2]]ρ is critically important, as it enables\\nself application and thereby general recursion via the Y combinator1. The EP\\nsemantics for function application is slightly more complex because the outputs\\nD′ must be ﬂattened to produce something in P(DP ) and not P(Pf(DP )). Note\\nthat in both of these semantics, the environment ρ maps variables to ﬁnite\\nsets, which either encode an integer n with a singleton {n} or encode a ﬁnite\\napproximation of a function {(D1, D′), . . . , (Dn, D′\\nn)}.\\n2.2\\nType-Theoretic Models\\nCoppo et al. [17] showed that a type system based on intersection types can\\ncharacterize the behavior of λ terms, in particular, showing that their type sys-\\ntem induced the same equalities as the P(ω) model of Scott [57]. Their work led\\nto a long line of research on ﬁlter models based on intersection types for many\\ndiﬀerent λ-calculi [6, 8, 18, 19, 31]. Barendregt et al. [11] give a detailed survey\\nof this work. Here we review an intersection type system that characterizes CBV\\nλ-calculus [8, 18, 54].\\nFigure 3 deﬁnes the syntax for types A, B, C ∈T, a subtyping relation A <:\\nB, and a type system Γ ⊢e : A. We write ⊤for the “top” of all function types,\\nwritten ν in the literature [22]. The λ-calculus we study here includes integers\\nand arithmetic, so we have added a singleton type n for every integer. We deﬁne\\na ﬁlter model EC in terms of the type system as follows. The domain is P(T).\\nECJeKΓ = {A | Γ ⊢e : A}\\nThe name ﬁlter comes from topology and order theory, and refers to a set that\\nis upward closed and closed under ﬁnite intersection. These two properties are\\nsatisﬁed by ﬁat in intersection type systems because of the subsumption and\\n∧-introduction rules.\\nAlessi et al. [6] show, for many variations of intersection type systems, that\\ntyping is preserved by both reduction and expansion, that is\\nPreservation under Reduction If Γ ⊢e : A and e −→e′, then Γ ⊢e′ : A.\\nPreservation under Expansion If Γ ⊢e′ : A and e −→e′, then Γ ⊢e : A.\\nWhile type systems generally preserve types under reduction, preserving under\\nexpansion is unusual and is what enables intersection type systems to completely\\ncharacterize the behavior of a program. In terms of the ﬁlter model, meaning is\\ninvariant under reduction: e −→e′ implies ECJeK = ECJe′K.\\n1 Really the Z combinator because we are in a call-by-value setting\\nVI\\nTypes\\nA, B, C ∈T ::= n | A →B | A ∧B | ⊤\\nSubtyping\\nA <: B\\nA →B <: ⊤\\nA <: A\\nA <: A ∧A\\nA ∧B <: A\\nA ∧B <: B\\n(A →B) ∧(A →C) <: A →(B ∧C)\\nA <: B\\nB <: C\\nA <: C\\nA <: A′\\nB <: B′\\nA ∧B <: A′ ∧B′\\nA′ <: A\\nB <: B′\\nA →B <: A′ →B′\\nTyping\\nΓ ⊢e : A\\nΓ ⊢n : n\\nΓ ⊢e1 : n1\\nΓ ⊢e2 : n2\\nΓ ⊢e1 ⊕e2 : n1 ⊕n2\\nΓ ⊢x : Γ(x)\\nΓ, x:A ⊢e : B\\nΓ ⊢λx. e : A →B\\nΓ ⊢λx. e : ⊤\\nΓ ⊢M : A\\nΓ ⊢M : B\\nΓ ⊢M : A ∧B\\nΓ ⊢e1 : A →B\\nΓ ⊢e2 : A\\nΓ ⊢e1 e2 : B\\nΓ ⊢e : A\\nA <: B\\nΓ ⊢e : B\\nΓ ⊢e1 : n\\nn ̸= 0\\nΓ ⊢e2 : B\\nΓ ⊢if e1 then e2 else e3 : B\\nΓ ⊢e1 : n\\nn = 0\\nΓ ⊢e3 : B\\nΓ ⊢if e1 then e2 else e3 : B\\nFig. 3. An intersection type system that characterizes the CBV λ-calculus.\\n3\\nA Straightforward Elementary Semantics\\nWe wish to use elementary semantics for the speciﬁcation of real programming\\nlanguages, so it is important that the semantics be as intuitive as possible. To\\npick some nits, the placement of ﬁnite sets in the domains of Plotkin and Engeler\\nis unintuitive. For example, one might naively think that the meaning of (λx. x+\\n1) would include an input-output entry such as (3, 4). But in Plotkin’s model\\nwe instead have ({3}, {4}) and in Engeler’s model we have ({3}, 4). However,\\nthere is a domain from the semantic subtyping literature that places the ﬁnite\\nsets where one would expect [27].\\nD = Z + Pf(D × D)\\nThe idea is straightforward: a function is represented by a ﬁnite approximation\\nof its graph. To our knowledge, this domain has never been used to give meaning\\nto programs, only to types.\\nSo the domain for our elementary semantics is P(D). Let t (for table) range\\nover Pf(D×D). We deﬁne the semantics E in Figure 4 to take an expression and\\nan environment and return a set of elements. Thanks to the change in domain,\\nthe environment ρ is simply a partial map from variables to elements (not sets\\nof elements).\\nThe meaning of a λx. e is the set of all ﬁnite graphs t such that for every\\ninput-output entry (d, d′) ∈t, the output element d′ is in the meaning of the body\\nVII\\nEJeKρ\\nEJλx.eKρ = {t | ∀(d, d′) ∈t. d′ ∈EJeKρ(x:=d)}\\nEJe1 e2Kρ =\\n\\x1a\\nd\\n\\x0c\\x0c\\x0c\\x0c\\n∃td1d′\\n1d2. t∈EJe1Kρ ∧d2∈EJe2Kρ\\n∧(d1, d′\\n1) ∈t ∧d1 ⊑d2 ∧d ⊑d′\\n1\\n\\x1b\\nEJxKρ = {d | d ⊑ρ(x)}\\nEJnKρ = {n}\\nEJe1 ⊕e2Kρ = {n1 ⊕n2 | n1 ∈EJe1Kρ ∧n2 ∈EJe2Kρ}\\nEJif e1 then e2 else e3Kρ =\\n\\x1a\\nd\\n\\x0c\\x0c\\x0c\\x0c ∃n. n ∈EJe1Kρ ∧(n ̸= 0 =⇒d ∈EJe2Kρ)\\n∧(n = 0 =⇒d ∈EJe3Kρ)\\n\\x1b\\nd ⊑d\\nn ⊑n\\nt ⊆t′\\nt ⊑t′\\nFig. 4. A new elementary semantics for CBV λ-calculus.\\ne in the environment where parameter x is bound to the input element d. The\\nmeaning of an application (e1 e2) is basically given by table lookup. That is, if\\nt ∈EJe1Kρ, (d1, d′\\n1) ∈t, d2 ∈EJe2Kρ and d1 = d2, then d′\\n1 ∈EJ(e1 e2)Kρ. However,\\nfollowing in the footsteps of the prior elementary semantics, we accommodate\\nself application by allowing the argument d2 to be a larger approximation than\\nthe input entry d1. To this end we deﬁne an ordering relation ⊑on D in Figure 4.\\nThus, instead of d1 = d2 we require d1 ⊑d2.\\n3.1\\nIs this semantics a ﬁlter model?\\nWe don’t yet know, but we have part of the story. Recall that a ﬁlter is a set that\\nis upward closed and closed under ﬁnite intersection. First, our ordering ⊑goes\\nthe opposite way, so the question is whether the semantics forms an ideal (the\\ndual of ﬁlter). Our semantics is downwards closed but we do not know whether\\nit is closed under ﬁnite union for arbitrary programs. However, it is closed under\\nﬁnite unions for closed syntactic values (integers and closed λ abstractions) which\\nis all that is required for correctness in a CBV setting (Section 5).\\nThe following deﬁnition lifts the information ordering to environments.\\nX ⊢ρ ⊑ρ′ ≡∀x. x ∈X =⇒ρ(x) ⊑ρ′(x)\\nρ ⊑ρ′ ≡∀x. ρ(x) ⊑ρ′(x)\\nProposition 1 (Downward closed aka. Subsumption).\\n1. If d ∈EJeKρ, d′ ⊑d, and fv(e) ⊢ρ ⊑ρ′, then d′ ∈EJeKρ′.\\n2. If d ∈EJeKρ, d′ ⊑d, then d′ ∈EJeKρ.\\nProof. The proof of part (1) is by induction on e. Part (2) follows from part (1).\\nVIII\\nThe proof of Proposition 1 is interesting in that it inﬂuenced our deﬁnition\\nof the semantics. Regarding variables, the semantics for a variable x includes\\nnot just the element ρ(x) but also all elements below ρ(x) (see Figure 4). If\\ninstead we had deﬁned EJxKρ = ρ(x), then the case for variables in the proof of\\nProposition 1 would break. The same can be said regarding d ⊑d′\\n1 in function\\napplication.\\nNext we consider ﬁnite unions, that is, we deﬁne a join operator on D.\\nn ⊔n = n\\nt ⊔t′ = t ∪t′\\nd ⊔d\\nOf course the join is not always deﬁned, e.g., there is no join of the integers 0\\nand 1. The join is indeed the least upper bound of ⊑.\\nProposition 2 (Join is the least upper bound of ⊑).\\n1. v1 ⊑v1 ⊔v2, v2 ⊑v1 ⊔v2, and\\n2. If v1 ⊑v3 and v2 ⊑v3, then v1 ⊔v2 ⊑v3.\\nWe write v for syntactic values that are closed:\\nv ::= n | λx. e\\nwhere fv(λx. e) = ∅\\nThe following lemma says that, if we have two elements d1, d2 in the meaning of\\na syntactic value v, then their join is too.\\nLemma 1 (Closed Under Join on Values). If d1 ∈EJvKρ and d2 ∈EJvKρ,\\nthen d1 ⊔d2 ∈EJvKρ.\\n3.2\\nIs this semantics fully abstract?\\nNo. Recall that a denotational semantics is fully abstract if contextual equiv-\\nalence implies denotational equivalence. Many denotational semantics are not\\nfully abstract, and neither is our elementary semantics. The upshot is that one\\ncannot use the inequality of two programs denotations to prove that they actu-\\nally behave diﬀerently. The counter example is the usual one: parallel-or. The\\nparallel-or function, por, takes two thunks, and returns true if either of them\\nreturns true. It cannot be implemented in a sequential language because inside\\npor, either f or g must be called ﬁrst. If the ﬁrst thunk goes into an inﬁnite\\nloop, then the second one will never be evaluated.\\nHowever, the domain P(D) contains a semantics for por as follows. For clarity,\\nwe add unit and pairs to the language and encode true as 1 and false as 0.\\nPOR = {((t1, t2), 1) | (unit, 1) ∈t1 ∨(unit, 1) ∈t2}\\n∪{((t1, t2), 0) | (unit, 0) ∈t1 ∧(unit, 0) ∈t2}\\nThis denotation will return true if either argument to POR returns true.\\nIX\\nNow to use POR to show that contextual equivalence does not imply denota-\\ntional equivalence. We ﬁrst deﬁne two test functions Ti for i ∈{0, 1} as follows.\\nLet Ωbe the divergent combinator (λx. xx) (λx. xx).\\nTi = λf. if f (λx. 1, λx. Ω) then\\nif f (λx. Ω, λx. 1) then\\nif f (λx. 0, λx. 0) then Ωelse i\\nelseΩ\\nelse Ω\\nWe have that T0 ≃T1, but EJT0K ̸= EJT1K. To see why T0 ≃T1, consider the\\npossibilities for the input. They could be given a function that 1) always diverges,\\n2) forces the ﬁrst thunk, 3) forces the second thunk, or 4) forces neither and\\nalways returns the same thing which could be a) zero, b) a non-zero integer, or\\nc) a function. In case 1), both T0 and T1 diverge in the ﬁrst call to f. In case 2),\\ndepending on the result of the ﬁrst call to f, both T0 and T1 either get stuck,\\ntake the else branch of the ﬁrst if and diverge, or take the then branch and\\ndiverge in the second call to f. In case 3), both T0 and T1 diverge on the ﬁrst\\ncall to f. In case 4a) both T0 and T1 take the else branch of the ﬁrst if and\\ndiverge. In case 4b) both T0 and T1 take the then branch of all three if ’s and\\ndiverge. In case 4c), both T0 and T1 get stuck after the ﬁrst call to f. So we have\\nT0 ≃T1, but it remains to show EJT0K ̸= EJT1K. We have that (POR, 0) ∈EJT0K\\nbut (POR, 0) ̸∈EJT1K.\\nWe note that Ronchi Della Rocca and Paolini [54] proved full abstraction for\\na ﬁlter model for the CBV λ-calculus at the cost of some added complexity.\\n3.3\\nExample of a Recursive Function\\nTo provide a concrete example of our semantics, we show the semantics of the\\nfactorial function, implemented using the Z combinator (the Y combinator for\\nstrict languages). The main idea for how our semantics gives meaning to recursive\\nfunctions is that of a Matryoshka doll: it nests ever-smaller versions of it’s graph\\ninside of them.\\nRecall the Z combinator:\\nM ≡λx. f (λv. (x x) v)\\nZ ≡λf. M M\\nThe factorial function is deﬁned as follows, with a parameter r for calling itself\\nrecursively. We give names (F and H) to the λ abstractions because we shall\\ndeﬁne tables for each of them.\\nF ≡λn. if n = 0 then 1 elsen × r (n −1)\\nH ≡λr. F\\nfact ≡Z H\\nWe begin with the tables for F: we deﬁne a function Ft that gives the table for\\njust one input n; it simply maps n to n factorial.\\nFt(n) = {(n, n!)}\\nX\\nThe tables for H map a factorial table for n −1 to a table for n. We invite the\\nreader to check that Ht(n) ∈EJHK∅for any n.\\nHt(n) = {(∅, Ft(0)), (Ft(0), Ft(1)), . . . , (Ft(n −1), Ft(n))}\\nNext we come to the most important part: describing the tables for M. Recall\\nthat M is applied to itself; this is where the analogy to Matryoshka dolls comes\\nin. We deﬁne Mt by recursion on n. Each Mt(n) extends the smaller version of\\nitself, Mt(n−1), with one more entry that maps the smaller version to the table\\nfor factorial of n −1.\\nMt(0) = ∅\\nMt(n) = Mt(n −1) ∪{(Mt(n −1), Ft(n −1))}\\nThe tables Mt are meanings for M because Mt(n + 1) ∈EJMK(f:=Ht(k)) for\\nany n ≤k. The application of M to itself is OK, Ft(n) ∈EJM MK(f:=Ht(k)),\\nbecause (Mt(n), Ft(n)) ∈Mt(n + 1), Mt(n) ⊑Mt(n + 1), and Ft(n) ⊑Ft(n).\\nTo ﬁnish things up, the tables for Z map the Ht’s to the factorial tables.\\nZt(n) = {(Ht(n), Ft(n))}\\nThen we have Zt(n) ∈EJZK∅for all n. So Ft(n) ∈EJZ HK∅for any n so we\\nconclude that n! ∈EJfact nK∅.\\n4\\nThe Elementary Semantics as a Type System\\nIn this section we present a type system based on intersection types, similar to\\nthe one in Section 2.2, and mechanize the proof that it is isomorphic to our\\nelementary semantics. The grammar of types is the following and consists of two\\nnon-terminals, one for types of functions and one for types in general.\\nF, G, H ::=A →B | F ∧G | ⊤\\ntypes of functions\\nA, B, C ∈T ::=n | F\\ntypes\\nAgain n is a singleton integer type. The intersection type G ∧H is for functions\\nthat have type F and G. All functions have type ⊤. The use of two non-terminals\\nenables the restriction of the intersection types to not include singleton integer\\ntypes, which would either be trivial (e.g. 1 ∧1) or garbage (e.g. 0 ∧1).\\nWe deﬁne subtyping <: and type equivalence ≈in Figure 5 but with fewer\\nrules than in Figure 3. We omit the following rules, i.e., the subtyping rule for\\nfunctions and for distributing intersections through functions, because they were\\nnot needed for the isomorphism with our elementary semantics, and therefore\\nnot needed in the proofs of correctness (Section 5).\\nA′ <: A\\nB <: B′\\nA →B <: A′ →B′\\n(C →A) ∧(C →B) <: C →(A ∧B)\\nXI\\nA <: B\\nF <: G\\nA <: A\\nA <: B\\nB <: C\\nA <: C\\nA ≈A′\\nB ≈B′\\nA →B <: A′ →B′\\nH <: F\\nH <: G\\nH <: F ∧G\\nF ∧G <: F\\nF ∧G <: G\\nA →B <: ⊤\\nA ≈B ≡A <: B and B <: A\\nFig. 5. Our subtyping relation on intersection types.\\nThe set of types T is isomorphic to the set D deﬁned in Section 3. The\\nsingleton types are isomorphic to integers. The function, intersection, and ⊤\\ntypes taken together are isomorphic to function tables. Each entry in a table\\ncorresponds to a function type. The following two functions, typof and eltof,\\nwitness the isomorphism. Strictly speaking, the isomorphism is between D and\\nT/≈, so elements of D are a canonical form for types.\\ntypof : D →T\\ntypof(n) = n\\ntypof(t) =\\n^\\n(d,d′)∈t\\ntypof(d)→typof(d′)\\neltof : T →D\\neltof(n) = {n}\\neltof(F) = tabof(F)\\ntabof(A →B) = {(eltof(A), eltof(B))}\\ntabof(A ∧B) = eltof(A) ∪eltof(B)\\ntabof(⊤) = ∅\\nThe subtyping relation of Figure 5 is the inverse of the ⊑ordering on D.\\nProposition 3 (Subtyping is inverse of ⊑and is related to ∈).\\n1.

Section 5.1 proves one direction of\\nthe equivalence and Section 5.2 proves the other. Then to justify the use of the\\nelementary semantics in compiler optimizations, we prove in Section 5.3 that it\\nis sound with respect to contextual equivalence.\\n5.1\\nSound with respect to operational semantics\\nIn this section we prove that the elementary semantics is sound with respect to\\nthe relational semantics of Kahn [38], written ρ ⊢e ⇒v. For each lemma and\\ntheorem we give a proof sketch that includes which other lemmas or theorems\\nwere needed. For the full details we refer the reader to the Isabelle mechanization.\\nWe relate D to sets of syntactic values V of Kahn [38] with the following\\nlogical relation. Logical relations are usually type-indexed, not element-indexed,\\nbut our domain elements are isomorphic to types.\\nG : D →P(V)\\nG(n) = {n}\\nG(t) =\\n\\x1a\\n⟨λx. e, ̺⟩\\n\\x0c\\x0c\\x0c\\x0c\\n∀(d1, d2)∈t.∀v1. v1∈G(d1) =⇒\\n∃v2. ̺(x:=v1) ⊢e ⇒v2 ∧v2∈G(d2)\\n\\x1b\\nLemma 2 (G is downward closed).

The proof is by induction on e. The cases for integers and arithmetic\\noperations are straightforward. The case for variables uses Lemmas 2 and 3.\\nThe cases for λ abstraction and application use Lemma 2.\\nTheorem 2 (Sound wrt. op. sem.). (aka. Adequacy)\\nIf EJeK∅= EJnK∅, then e ⇓n.\\nProof. From the premise we have n ∈EJeK∅. Also we immediately have G(∅, ∅).\\nSo by Lemma 4 we have ∅⊢e ⇒v and v ∈G(n) for some v. So v = n and\\ntherefore e ⇓n.\\nThis proof of soundness can also be viewed as a proof of implementation\\ncorrectness. The operational semantics, being operational, can be viewed as a\\nkind of implementation, and in this light, the above proof is an example of how\\nconvenient it can be to prove (one direction of) implementation correctness using\\nthe elementary semantics as the speciﬁcation.\\n5.2\\nComplete with respect to operational semantics\\nIn this section we prove that the elementary semantics is complete with respect\\nto the small-step semantics for the CBV λ-calculus [47]. The proof strategy is\\nadapted from work by Alessi et al. [6] on intersection types. We need to show\\nthat if e −→∗n, then EJeK∅= EJnK∅. The meaning of the last expression in the\\nreduction sequence is equal to EJnK∅, so if we could just walk this backwards, one\\nstep at a time, we would have our result. That is, we need to show that if e −→e′,\\nthen EJeKρ = EJe′Kρ. We can decompose the equality into EJeKρ ⊆EJe′Kρ and\\nEJe′Kρ ⊆EJeKρ. The forward direction is equivalent to proving type preservation\\nfor our intersection type system, which is straightforward. Let us focus on the\\nbackward direction and the case of β reduction.\\nConsider the following example reduction:\\n(λx. (x 1) + (x 2)) (λy. . . .) −→((λy. . . .) 1) + ((λy. . . .) 2)\\nwhere e = (λx. . . .) (λy. . . .) and e′ = ((λy. . . .) 1) + ((λy. . . .) 2). For some\\narbitrary d, we can assume that d ∈EJe′K∅and need to show d ∈EJeK∅. From\\nd ∈EJe′K∅we know there must have been some tables t1 and t2 such that\\nt1 ∈EJλy. . . .K∅and t2 ∈EJλy. . . .K∅, but we only know for sure that 1 is in the\\ndomain of t1 and 2 is in the domain of t2. Perhaps t1 = {(1, 7)} and t2 = {(2, 0)}.\\nHowever, to obtain d ∈EJeK∅we need a single table t3 that can be bound to\\nvariable x, and has both 1 and 2 in its domain so that the applications (x 1) and\\n(x 2) make sense. Fortunately, we can simply combine the two tables (Lemma 1).\\nt3 = t1 ∪t2 = {(1, 7), (2, 0)}\\n(1)\\nXIV\\nIn general, we also need a lemma about reverse substitution. Recall the rule\\nfor β reduction\\n(λx. e1) v −→e1[v/x]\\nThen we need a lemma that says, for any d1, there is some d2 ∈EJvK∅such that\\nd1 ∈EJe1[v/x]K∅\\nimplies\\nd1 ∈EJe1K∅(x:=d2).\\nGeneralizing this so that it can be proved by induction gives us Lemma 5 below.\\nWe proceed with the formal development of the completeness proof. We deﬁne\\nequivalence of environments, written ρ ≈ρ′, and note that ρ ≈ρ′ implies ρ ⊑ρ′.\\nρ ≈ρ′ ≡∀x. ρ(x) = ρ′(x)\\nLemma 5 (Reverse substitution preserves meaning). If d ∈EJe[v/y]Kρ,\\nthen d ∈EJeKρ′, d′ ∈EJvK∅, and ρ′ ≈ρ(y:=d′) for some ρ′, d′.\\nProof.\\nThe proof is by induction on e′ = e[v/y]. But before considering the\\ncases for e′, we ﬁrst consider whether or not e = y. The proof uses Propositions\\n1 and 6 and Lemma 1.\\nLemma 6 (Reverse reduction preserves meaning).\\n1. If e −→e′, then EJe′Kρ ⊆EJeKρ.\\n2. If e −→∗e′, then EJe′Kρ ⊆EJeKρ.\\nProof.\\n1. The proof is by induction on the derivation of e −→e′. All of the cases are\\nstraightforward except for β reduction. In that case we have (λx. e1) v −→\\ne1[v/x]. Fix an arbitrary d and assume d ∈EJe1[v/x]Kρ. We need to show\\nthat d ∈EJ(λx. e1) vKρ. By Lemma 5 and the assumption there exist d′\\nand ρ′ such that d ∈EJe1Kρ′, d′ ∈EJvK∅, and ρ′ ≈ρ(x:=d′). Then we have\\nd ∈EJe1Kρ(x:=d′) by Proposition 1, noting that ρ′ ⊑ρ(x:=d′). Therefore\\nwe have {(d′, d)} ∈EJλx. e1Kρ. Also, we have d′ ∈EJvKρ by another use of\\nProposition 1, noting that ∅⊑ρ. With these two facts, we conclude that\\nd ∈EJ(λx. e1) vKρ.\\n2. The proof is by induction on the derivation of e −→∗e′. The base case is\\ntrivial and the induction step follows immediately from part (1).\\nNext we prove the forward direction, that reduction preserves meaning. The\\nproof follows the usual pattern for preservation of a type system. However, we\\nshall continue to use the denotational semantics here.\\nLemma 7 (Substitution preserves meaning).

The two directions are proved by Lemma 6 and 8.\\nTheorem 3 (Complete wrt. op. sem.). If e ⇓n, then EJeK∅= EJnK∅.\\nProof. From the premise we have e −→∗n, from which we conclude by use of\\nLemma 1.\\nThe completeness theorem is rather important for the elementary semantics.\\nIt says that E gives the right meaning to all the terminating programs in the\\nCBV λ-calculus.\\nWe also prove that E gives the right meaning to diverging programs. That\\nis, E maps diverging programs to ∅. We write e ⇑when e diverges.\\nProposition 5 (Diverging programs have empty meaning).\\nIf e ⇑then EJeK∅= ∅.\\nProof. Towards a contradiction, suppose EJeK∅̸= ∅. So d ∈EJeK∅for some d.\\nWe have G(∅, ∅), so ∅⊢e ⇒v by Lemma 4. Thus, we also have e −→∗v. Then\\nfrom e ⇑, we have v −→e′ for some e′, but that is impossible because v is a\\nvalue and so cannot further reduce.\\nIn contrast, syntactic values have non-empty meaning.\\nProposition 6 (Syntactic values have non-empty meaning). EJvKρ ̸= ∅.\\nProof. The proof is by case analysis on v.\\n5.3\\nSound with respect to contextual equivalence\\nWe would like to use our elementary semantics to justify compiler optimizations,\\nwhich replace sub-expressions within a program with other sub-expressions (that\\nare hopefully more eﬃcient). Two sub-expressions are contextual equivalent, de-\\nﬁned below, when replacing one with the other does not change the behavior of\\nthe program [45]. We deﬁne contexts C with the following grammar.\\nC ::= C ⊕e | e ⊕C | λx. C | C e | e C\\ncontexts\\ne ≃e′ ≡∀C. FV (C[e]) = FV (C[e′]) = ∅=⇒C[e] ⇓iﬀC[e′] ⇓\\nctx. equivalence\\nXVI\\nThe correctness property that we are after is that denotational equality\\nshould imply contextual equivalence. A common way to prove this is to show\\nthat the denotational semantics is a congruence and then use soundness and\\ncompleteness of the semantics for programs [29]. Indeed, we take that approach.\\nLemma 9 (E is a congruence). For any context C, if EJeK = EJe′K, then\\nEJC[e]K = EJC[e′]K.\\nProof. The proof is a straightforward induction on C.\\nTheorem 4 (Sound wrt. Contextual Equivalence).\\nIf EJeK = EJe′K, then C[e] ⇓iﬀC[e′] ⇓for any closing context C.\\nProof. We discuss one direction of the iﬀ, that C[e] ⇓implies C[e′] ⇓. The other\\ndirection is similar. From the premise, congruence gives us EJC[e]K = EJC[e′]K.\\nFrom C[e] ⇓we have C[e] −→∗e for some e. Therefore we have EJC[e]K∅=\\nEJeK∅by completeness (Theorem 3). Then we also have EJC[e′]K∅= EJeK. So\\nby Proposition 6, we have v ∈EJeK for some v, and therefore v ∈EJC[e′]K. We\\nconclude that ∅⊢C[e′] ⇒w for some w by soundness (Lemma 4).\\n6\\nMechanized Correctness of an Optimizer\\nWe turn to address the question of whether the declarative semantics is use-\\nful. Our ﬁrst case study is proving the correctness of a compiler optimization\\npass: constant folding and function inlining. The setting is still the untyped λ-\\ncalculus extended with integers and arithmetic. Figure 7 deﬁnes the optimizer as\\na function O that maps an expression and a counter to an expression. One of the\\nchallenging problems in creating a good inliner is determining when to stop. Here\\nwe use a counter that limits inlining to a ﬁxed depth k. A real compiler would\\nuse a smarter heuristic but it would employ the same program transformations.\\nThe third equation in the deﬁnition of O performs constant folding. For an\\narithmetic operation e1 ⊕e2, it recursively optimizes e1 and e2. If the results\\nare integers, then it performs the arithmetic. Otherwise it outputs an arithmetic\\nexpression. The fourth equation optimizes the body of a λ abstraction. The ﬁfth\\nequation, for function application, is the most interesting. If e1 optimizes to a λ\\nabstraction and e2 optimizes to a syntactic value v2, then we perform inlining\\nby substituting v2 for parameter x in the body of the function. We then opti-\\nmize the result of the substitution, making this a rather aggressive polyvariant\\noptimizer [10, 35, 66, 67]. The counter is decremented on this recursive call to\\nensure termination.\\nWe turn to proving the optimizer correct with respect to the declarative\\nsemantics. The proof is pleasantly straightforward!\\nLemma 10 (Optimizer Preserves Denotations). E(OJeKk) = EJeK\\nProof. The proof is by induction on the termination metric for O, which is the\\nlexicographic ordering of k then the size of e. All the cases are straightforward\\nto prove because reduction preserves meaning (Lemma 1) and because meaning\\nis a congruence (Lemma 9).\\nXVII\\nOJxKk = x\\nOJnKk = n\\nOJe1 ⊕e2Kk =\\n(\\nn1 ⊕n2\\nif OJe1Kk = n1 and OJe2Kk = n2\\nJOJe1Kk ⊕OJe2KkK\\notherwise\\nOJλx. eKk = λx.

The proof follows immediately from the above Lemma 10 and soundness\\nwith respect to contextual equivalence (Theorem 4).\\n7\\nElementary Semantics in a Non-determinism Monad\\nToward making the elementary semantics easier to scale to larger languages, we\\nshow how to hide the set-valued aspect of the denotation function EJeKρ behind\\na non-determinism monad [69]. Recall that a non-deterministic computation\\nreturns not just one result, but a set of results. Non-deterministic choice is\\nprovided by the bind operation. It chooses, one at a time, an element a from a\\nsub-computation m, and proceeds with another sub-computation f that depends\\non a, then collect all the results into a set. The following is the deﬁnition of bind\\ntogether with short-hand notation.\\nbind : P(α) →(α →P(β)) →P(β)\\nbind m f = {b | ∃a. a ∈m ∧b ∈f(a)}\\nX ←m1; m2 ≡bind m1 (λX. m2)\\nBacktracking is provided by the way the zero operation interacts with bind. The\\nzero operation simply says to “fail” or “abort” by returning an empty set.\\nzero : P(α)\\nzero = ∅\\nAs usual, the monad also provides a return operation to inject a result into the\\nmonad, in this case producing a (singleton) set.\\nreturn : α →P(α)\\nreturn a = {a}\\nXVIII\\nWith these monad operations in hand, we create some auxiliary functions\\nthat are needed for the interpreter. The following mapM function applies a func-\\ntion f to each element of a ﬁnite set, producing a ﬁnite set, all within the\\nnon-determinism monad. (We write ⊎for the union of two sets that have no\\nelements in common.)\\nmapM : Pf(α) →(α →P(β)) →P(Pf(β))\\nmapM ∅f = return ∅\\nmapM ({a} ⊎as) f = b ←f(a); bs ←mapM as f; return {b} ∪bs\\nThe next auxiliary function makes sure that the semantics is downward closed\\nwith respect to ⊑. The function down d chooses an arbitrary element d′ and\\nreturns it if d′ ⊑d and otherwise backtracks to pick another element.\\ndown : D →P(D)\\ndown d = d′ ←D; if d′ ⊑d then return d′ else zero\\nThe non-deterministic interpreter for the CBV λ-calculus is deﬁned in Fig-\\nure 8. Let us focus on the cases for λ abstractions and function application. The\\ncases for integers, arithmetic, and conditionals look just as they would for any\\ninterpreter in monadic style. For EJλx. eKρ, we non-deterministically choose a\\nﬁnite domain ds and then map over it to produce the function’s table. For each\\ninput d, we interpret the body e in an environment extended with x bound to d.\\nThis produces the output d′, which we pair with d to form one entry in the table.\\nFor application EJe1 e2Kρ, we interpret e1 and e2 to the elements d1 and d2, then\\ncheck whether d1 is a function table. If it is, we non-deterministically select an\\nentry (d, d′) from the table and see if the argument d2 matches the parameter\\nd. If so we return down d′, otherwise we backtrack and try another entry in the\\ntable or possibly backtrack even further and try another table altogether!\\n8\\nElementary Semantics and Soundness for System F\\nThis section serves two purposes: it demonstrates that our elementary semantics\\nis straightforward to extend to a typed language with ﬁrst-class polymorphism,\\nand it demonstrates how to use the elementary semantics to prove type sound-\\nness. Our setting is the polymorphic λ-calculus (System F) [28, 52] extended\\nwith general recursion (fix). The idea is that this section is a generalization of\\nMilner’s “well-typed expressions do not go wrong” [43].\\n8.1\\nStatic Semantics\\nThe syntax and type system of this language is deﬁned in Figure 9. We represent\\ntype variables using DeBruijn indices, with ∀and Λ acting as implicit binding\\nforms. The shift operation ↑k\\nc (A) increases the DeBruijn indices greater or equal\\nto c in type A by k and the substitution operation [i 7→B]A replaces DeBruijn\\nindex i within type A with type B [47].\\nXIX\\nEJeKρ\\nEJnKρ = return n\\nEJe1 ⊕e2Kρ = d1 ←EJe1Kρ; d2 ←EJe2Kρ;\\ncase (d1, d2) of (n1, n2) ⇒return n1 ⊕n2 |\\n⇒zero\\nEJxKρ = down ρ(x)\\nEJλx.eKρ = ds ←Pf(D); mapM ds (λd. d′ ←EJeKρ(x:=d); return (d, d′))\\nEJe1 e2Kρ = d1 ←EJe1Kρ; d2 ←EJe2Kρ;\\ncase d1 of\\nt ⇒(d, d′) ←t; if d ⊑d2 then down d′ else zero\\n|\\n⇒zero\\nEJif e1 then e2 else e3Kρ = d1 ←EJe1Kρ;\\ncase d1 of\\nn ⇒if n ̸= 0 then EJe2Kρ else EJe3K\\n|\\n⇒zero\\nFig. 8.

Syntax and type system of System F extended with general recursion (via fix).\\nXX\\nType environments and their operations deserve some explanation in the way\\nthey handle type variables. A type environment Γ is a pair consisting of 1) a\\nmapping for term variables and 2) a natural number representing the number of\\nenclosing type-variable binders. The mapping is from variables names to a pair\\nof a) the variable’s type and b) the number of enclosing type-variable binders at\\nthe variable’s point of deﬁnition. We deﬁne the operations extend, tyExtend, and\\nlookup in the following way.\\nextend(Γ, x, A) ≡(fst(Γ)(x:=(A, snd(Γ)), snd(Γ))\\ntyExtend(Γ) ≡(fst(Γ), snd(Γ) + 1)\\nlookup(Γ, x) ≡↑k−j\\n0\\n(A)\\nwhere (A, j) = fst(Γ)(x) and k = snd(Γ)\\nThus, the lookup operation properly transports the type of a variable from its\\npoint of deﬁnition to its occurrence by shifting its type variables the appropriate\\namount. We say that a type environment Γ is well-formed if snd(fst(Γ)(x)) ≤\\nsnd(Γ) for all x ∈dom(fst(Γ)).\\n8.2\\nDenotational Semantics\\nThe domain diﬀers from that of the λ-calculus in two respects. First, we add a\\nwrong element to represent a runtime type error, just like Milner [43]. Second,\\nwe add an element to represent type abstraction. From a runtime point of view,\\na type abstraction Λe simply produces a thunk. That is, it delays the execution\\nof expression e until the point of type application (aka. instantiation). A thunk\\ncontains an optional element: if the expression e does not terminate, then the\\nthunk contains none, otherwise the thunk contains the result of e.\\no ::= none | some(d)\\noptional elements\\nt ::= {(d1, d′\\n1), . . . , (dn, d′\\nn)}\\ntables\\nd ::= n | t | thunk(o) | wrong\\nelements\\nBuilding on the non-determinism monad (Section 7), we add support for the\\nshort-circuiting due to errors with the following alternative form of bind.\\nX := E1; E2 ≡X ←E1; if X = wrong then return wrong else E2\\nWe deﬁne an auxiliary function apply to give the semantics of function appli-\\ncation. The main diﬀerence with respect to Figure 8 is returning wrong when e1\\nproduces a result that is not a function table. We also replace uses of ←with :=\\nto short-circuit the computation in case wrong is produced by a sub-computation.\\napply(D1, D2) = d1 := D1; d2 := D2;\\ncase d1 of t ⇒(d, d′) ←t; if d ⊑d2 then down d′ else zero\\n|\\n⇒return wrong\\nAn elementary semantics for System F extended with fix is deﬁned in Fig-\\nure 10.

An elementary semantics for System F with general recursion.\\noperations return wrong when an input in not an integer. Regarding λ abstrac-\\ntion, the semantics is the same as for the untyped λ-calculus (Figure 8).\\nTo give meaning to (fix x:A. e) we form its ascending Kleene chain but never\\ntake its supremum. In other words, we deﬁne a auxiliary function iterate that\\nstarts with no tables (∅) and then iteratively feeds the function to itself some\\nﬁnite number of times, produces ever-larger sets of tables that better approxi-\\nmate the function. The parameter L is the meaning function E partially applied\\nto the expression e. We fully apply L inside of iterate, binding x to the previous\\napproximations.\\nThe declarative semantics of polymorphism is straightforward. The meaning\\nof a type abstraction Λe is thunk(some(d)) if e evaluates to d. The meaning of Λe\\nis thunk(none) if e diverges. The meaning of a type application e[A] is to force\\nthe thunk, that is, it is any element below d if e evaluates to thunk(some(d)). On\\nthe other hand, if e evaluates to thunk(none), then the type application diverges.\\nFinally, if e evaluates to something other than a thunk, the result is wrong.\\nOne strength of this elementary semantics is that it enables the use of monads\\nto implicitly handle error propagation, which is important for scaling up to large\\nlanguage speciﬁcations [9, 15, 46].\\n8.3\\nSemantics of Types\\nWe deﬁne types in the domain P(D) with the meaning function T deﬁned in\\nFigure 11. The meaning of int is the integers. To handle type variables, T has a\\nsecond parameter η that maps each DeBruijn index to a set of elements, i.e., the\\nXXII\\nT JintKη = Z\\nT JiKη =\\n(\\ncleanup(ηi)\\nif i < |η|\\n∅\\notherwise\\nT JA →BKη = {t | ∀(d1, d′\\n2) ∈t. d1 ∈T JAKη =⇒∃d2. d2 ∈T JBKη ∧d′\\n2 ⊑d2}\\nT J∀AKη = {thunk(some(d)) | ∀D. d ∈T JAKDη} ∪{thunk(none)}\\ncleanup(D) ≡{d | ∃d′. d′ ∈D ∧d ⊑d′ ∧d ̸= wrong}\\nFig. 11.

The cleanup\\nfunction serves to make sure that T is downward closed and that it does not\\ninclude wrong. (Putting the use of cleanup in T JiK instead of T J∀AK makes for a\\nslightly simpler deﬁnition of well-typed environments, which is deﬁned below.)\\nWe write |η| for the length of a sequence η. The meaning of a function type\\nA →B is all the ﬁnite tables t in which those entries with input in T JAK have\\noutput in T JBK.\\nLast but not least, the meaning of a universal type ∀A includes thunk(none)\\nbut also thunk(some(d)) whenever d is in the meaning of A but with η extended\\nwith an arbitrary set of elements.\\nWe write ⊢ρ, η : Γ to say that environments ρ and η are well-typed according\\nto Γ and deﬁne it inductively as follows.\\n⊢∅, ∅: empty\\n⊢ρ, η : Γ\\nv ∈T JAKη\\n⊢ρ(x:=v), η : extend(Γ, x, A)\\n⊢ρ, η : Γ\\n⊢ρ, V η : tyExtend(Γ)\\n8.4\\nType Soundness\\nWe prove type soundness for System F, that is, if a program is well-typed and\\nhas type A, then its meaning (in a well-typed environment) is a subset of the\\nmeaning of its type A.\\nTheorem 1 (Semantic Soundness).\\nIf Γ ⊢e : A and ⊢ρ, η : Γ, then EJeKρ ⊆T JAKη.\\nWe use four small lemmas.

The proof is by induction on the derivation of ⊢ρ, η : Γ.

The proof is direct and uses lemmas 12 and 11.\\nWhen it comes to polymorphism, our proof necessarily diﬀers considerably from\\nMilner’s, as we must deal with ﬁrst-class polymorphism. So instead of Milner’s\\nProposition 4 (about type substitution), we instead have a Compositionality\\nLemma analogous to what you would ﬁnd in a proof of Parametricity [62].

The proof is by induction on the derivation of Γ ⊢e : A. The case for\\nvariables uses Lemmas 11 and 15. The case for application uses Lemma 16. The\\ncase for fix applies Lemma 18, using the induction hypothesis to establish the\\nsecond premise of that lemma. The case for type application uses Lemma 17.\\n8.5\\nComparison to Syntactic Type Safety\\nThe predominant approach to proving type safety of a programming language\\nis via progress and preservation [30, 41, 47, 73] over a small-step operational\\nsemantics. Recall that the Progress Lemma says that a well-typed program can\\neither reduce or it is a value, but it is never stuck, which would correspond to a\\nruntime type error. The strength of this syntactic approach is that the semantics\\ndoes not need to explicitly talk about runtime type errors, but nevertheless they\\nare ruled out by the Progress Lemma.\\nIn comparison, the semantic soundness approach that we used in this section\\nrelies on using an explicit wrong element to distinguish between programs that\\ndiverge versus programs that encounter a runtime type error. The downside of\\nthis approach is that the author of the semantics could mix up wrong and zero\\n(divergence) and the Semantic Soundness (Theorem 1) would still hold. However,\\na simple auditing of the semantics can catch this kind of mistake. Also, we plan\\nto investigate whether techniques such as step-indexing [9, 46, 61] could be used\\nto distinguish divergence from wrong.\\n8.6\\nFrom Type Soundness to Parametricity\\nAn exciting direction for future research is to use the elementary semantics for\\nproving Parametricity and using it to construct Free Theorems, replacing the\\nframe models in the work of Wadler [68]. The idea would be to to adapt T ,\\nour unary relation on D, into V, a binary relation on D. We would deﬁne the\\nfollowing logical relation R in terms of V and the semantics E.\\nRJAKη = {(e1, e2) | ∃v1v2. v1 ∈EJe1K∅∧v2 ∈EJe1K∅∧(v1, v2) ∈VJAKη}\\nThen the Parametricity Theorem could be formulated as:\\nIf Γ ⊢e : A and ⊢ρ, η : Γ, then (e, e) ∈RJAKη.\\nThe proof would likely be similar to our proof of Semantic Soundness.\\nXXV\\n9\\nRelated Work\\nIntersection Type Systems The type system view of our elementary semantics\\n(Section 4) is a variant of the intersection type system invented by Coppo et al.\\n[17] to study the untyped λ-calculus. Researchers have studied numerous prop-\\nerties and variations of the intersection type system [6, 8, 18, 19, 31]. Our mech-\\nanized proof of completeness with respect to operational semantics (Section 5.2)\\nis based on a (non-mechanized) proof by Alessi et al. [6].\\nBy making subtle changes to the subtyping relation it is possible to cap-\\nture alternate semantics [7] such as call-by-value [22, 54] or lazy evaluation [2].\\nBarendregt et al. [11] give a thorough survey of these type systems. Our ⊤type\\ncorresponds to the type ν of Egidi et al. [22] and Alessi et al. [6]. Our subtyp-\\ning relation is rather minimal, omitting the usual rules for function subtyping\\nand the distributive rule for intersections and function types. Our study of sin-\\ngleton integer types within an intersection type system appears to be a novel\\ncombination.\\nIntersection type systems have played a role in the full abstraction problem\\nfor the lazy λ-calculus, in the guise of domain logics [1, 2, 37]\\nThe problem of inhabitation for intersection type systems has seen recent\\nprogress [21] and applications to example-directed synthesis [26].\\nOther Semantics There are many other approaches to programming language\\nsemantics that we have not discussed, from axiomatic semantics [25, 32] to\\ngames [3, 34], event structures [71], and traces [36, 53]. Our function tables\\ncan be viewed as ﬁnitary versions of the tree models for SPCF [13, 14], a lan-\\nguage with exceptions, and we are interested in seeing whether our model might\\nbe fully abstract in that setting.\\n10\\nConclusions and Future Work\\nIn this paper we present an elementary semantics for a CBV λ-calculus that rep-\\nresents a λ abstraction with an inﬁnite set of ﬁnite tables. We give a mechanized\\nproof that this semantics is correct with respect to the operational semantics of\\nthe CBV λ-calculus and we present two case studies that begin to demonstrate\\nthat this semantics is useful. We leverage the compositionality of our semantics\\nin a proof of correctness for a compiler optimization. We extend the semantics\\nto handle parametric polymorphism and prove type soundness, i.e., well-typed\\nprograms cannot go wrong.\\nOf course, we have just scratched the surface in investigating how well ele-\\nmentary semantics scales to full programming languages. We invite the reader\\nto help us explore elementary semantics for mutable state, exceptions, continu-\\nations, recursive types, dependent types, objects, threads, shared memory, and\\nlow-level languages, to name just a few. Regarding applications, there is plenty\\nto try regarding proofs of program correctness and compiler correctness. For\\nyour next programming languages project, give elementary semantics a try!\\nBibliography\\n[1]\\nS.

      "{'title': 'Generative artificial intelligence', 'summary': 'Generative artificial intelligence (Generative AI or GenAI) is a subfield of artificial intelligence that uses generative models to generate text, images, videos, audio, software code or other forms of data. These models learn the underlying patterns and structures of their training data and use them to produce new data in response to input, which often comes in the form of natural language prompts.\\nThe prevalence of generative AI tools has increased significantly since the AI boom in the 2020s. This boom was made possible by improvements in deep neural networks, particularly large language models (LLMs), which are based on the transformer architecture. Major tools include LLM-based chatbots such as ChatGPT, Claude, Copilot, DeepSeek, Google Gemini and Grok; text-to-image models such as Stable Diffusion, Midjourney, and DALL-E; and text-to-video models such as Veo, LTX and Sora. Technology companies developing generative AI include Alibaba, Anthropic, Baidu, DeepSeek, Google, Lightricks, Meta AI, Microsoft, Mistral AI, OpenAI, Perplexity AI, xAI, and Yandex.\\nGenerative AI has been adopted in a variety of sectors, including software development, healthcare, finance, entertainment, customer service, sales and marketing, art, writing, and product design.  \\nGenerative AI has been used for cybercrime, and to deceive and manipulate people through fake news and deepfakes. Generative AI may lead to mass replacement of human jobs. The tools themselves have been described as violating intellectual property laws, since they are trained on copyrighted works. Many generative AI systems use large-scale data centers whose environmental impacts include e-waste, consumption of fresh water for cooling, and high energy consumption that is estimated to be growing steadily. Generative AI continues to evolve rapidly as new models and applications emerge.', 'source': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_artificial_intelligence'}\n",
